# Chicken Weight Analysis

The project contains the Rmarkdown code file that showcases some of the concepts learned for the Data Science Immersive course. The concepts are demonstarted using R and include:</br> 
- Data Visualization
- Descriptive Statistics
- Inferential Statistics 

Additionally, the project includes the outputted HTML document of the Rmarkdown file, which can also be viewed here: [HTML Website](https://ayah-kamal.github.io/chickenweightanalysis//ReproducibleResearch.html)

## Background
As mentioned before, this project marks the first step into building a portfolio to document the learning outcomes from the Data Science Immersive course. The simple `chickwts` dataset is used for the demonstrations. This project acts as an introduction to writing Rmarkdown. While writing the Rmarkdown file, I learned the main components of an Rmarkdown file such as the YAML header and how to section codes. There was also some CSS coding done for the styling of the HTML document.
